# Problems when translating
These are the main things that make translation 'an art, not a science', and things to watch out for when translating either into German or into English, as they may cause difficulty
 - Germanic phrasing - for example, in the sentence 'Ich lade musik herunter, weil das einfach ist', the 'das' would translate not to 'that', but to 'it'. Similarly, lots of the time when in German 'mann' would be used, it would be better translated into English as 'you'.
 - Idioms - for example, 'was ist los' is difficult to translate without context, and wouldn't be direct - it might mean 'what is happening', for example.
 - Prepositions - English and German often use different prepositions when describing things. Examples would be 'Ich denke an' ('I think ABOUT', not 'I think ON'), and 'Ich fahre mit dem bus' ('I travel ON the bus', not 'I travel With')
 - Not knowing vocab - easier to deal with when translating into English than into German, as it's often possible to make an educated guess about what goes in the gap. Easiest solution is just learn all vocab inside out.

# Writing summaries
Some things to think about when writing summaries:
 - "A summary should include everything necessary to understand the work without reading the whole piece."
 - think about the text in sections
 - think in terms of question words (who, what, where, when, why, how)
 - follow the order of the original text
 - stick to what's in the text - no personal opinions
 - using topic-specific vocab is ok - don't spend ages trying to paraphrase one difficult word
 - jottin down (for listenings), or highlighting (for readings) key points as they come up can be a good way of forming a skeleton answer

# Misc tips
## Which case for 'in'?
One way to test whether an occurence of 'in' takes dative (no movement) or accusative (movement) is to translate into English and see whether it translates best as 'in' or 'into', with 'into' taking accusative.
