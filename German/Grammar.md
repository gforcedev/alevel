# da with prepositions
When used with a preposition, "da" would roughly translate to "it" in the following manner:

German|English
:---:|:---:
damit|with it
darauf|on it
daran|on it
etc.|etc.

# Fractions
Fractions work similarly to cardinal numbers, but they drop the trailing 'n' and add an 'l'.

To say 'one in seven' or 'every seventh', you would say 'jeder siebte' (drop the trailing 'n' entirely and don't add anything)

    German|English
    :---:|:---:
    halb|half (its special)
    drittel|third
    viertel|quarter
    neunzehntel|nineteenth
    zwanzigstel|twentieth
    etc.|etc.

# Passive Voice
Used in sentences without a subject. To form it, use a form of "werden" with a past participle.

    German|English
    :---:|:---:
    Ich esse den Apfel|I am eating the apple
    Der Apfel wird gegessen|The apple is being eaten

# Saying decimal numbers
Decimal numbers are said with the number before the decimal, "Komma" (as in, the comma used instead of a decimal point in German), and then each number individually (or the whole number again).

For example, 23.45 could be "Drei-und-zwanzig-komma-vier-fünf" or "Drei-und-zwanzig-komma-fünf-und-vierzig"

# People as 'the'
Colloquially, people can sometimes be referred to using the definite article. For example, "was meinen Vater betrifft, den finde ich..." would translate to "when it comes to my father, I find **him**"

# Cases
There are four cases in German. They are:
## Nominative
The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence, and also used for the subject of the sein. For example, "ich bin **der** lehrer"
## Accusative
The accusative case is used for the direct object of a sentence and also used with certain prepositions. These follow the acronym FUDGEBOW, and are:
 - für
 - um
 - durch
 - gegen
 - entlang (which is also special in another way - it always goes at the end of a sentence)
 - bis
 - ohne
 - wider

## Genitive
The genitive case is used to convey the possesion. That is, the meaning "of". For example, "die pfoten des hundes" would literally translate to "the paws of the dog", but better idiomatic English would be "the dog's paws". It also gets used after certain prepositions. These are:
- während
- trotz
- statt
- wegen
- innerhalb
- ausserhalb
- jenseits
- dieseits
- unweit

Another important thing to note about genitive is that when using genitive with masculine or neuter words, the nouns themselves will also have an ending appended.

## Dative
The dative case implies the word "to" or "for". It's used with the indirect object of a sentence, with certain verbs, and with certain prepositions. There are lots of verbs that take the dative - a good list is available at https://deutsch.ie/german-grammar/german-verbs/german-verbs-dative-verbs/. A couple of common ones would be helfen and gefallen. The dative case is also used with certain prepositions. These are:
 - mit
 - nach
 - seit
 - von
 - zu
 - ab
 - bei
 - aus
 - ausser
 - gegenüber

# The table of truth
Marvel at its beauty and its truthfulness. Also learn it.
Case|Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|Plural/None
---|---|---|---|---|---
Nominative|Der/Ein|Die/Eine|Das/Ein|Die/Keine
Accusative|Den/Einen|Die/Eine|Das/Ein|Die/Keine
Genitive|Des/Eines|Der/Einer|Des/Eines|Der/Keiner
Dative|Dem/Einem|Der/Einer|Dem/Einem|Den/Keinen

# Adjective endings
Adjective endings are different depending on whether the definite, indefinite, or no article was used before them. This is so that the gender of the word is apparent (most of the time). The tables can be thought of using the image of a 'meat cleaver' - highlighted with the bold ones in this table.

## Adjective endings for the definite article
Case|Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|Plural/None
---|---|---|---|---|---
Nominative|**e**|**e**|**e**|en
Accusative|en|**e**|**e**|en
Genitive|en|en|en|en
Dative|en|en|en|en

For the indefinite, then all of the 'en' endings are the same as the definite, but the masculine and neuter 'e's change so that they reflect the gender (otherwise you wouldn't be able to tell the gender of a word).

## Adjective endings for the definite article
Case|Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|Plural/None
---|---|---|---|---|---
Nominative|**er**|**e**|**es**|en
Accusative|en|**e**|**es**|en
Genitive|en|en|en|en
Dative|en|en|en|en

When there's no article used, the endings are all different, in order to reflect the verb used - the table mostly mirrors the last parts of the definite articles but with the 'es' from 'des' changed to being 'en'.

## Adjective endings for the definite article
Case|Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|Plural/None
---|---|---|---|---|---
Nominative|er|e|es|e
Accusative|en|e|es|e
Genitive|en|er|en|er
Dative|em|er|em|en
