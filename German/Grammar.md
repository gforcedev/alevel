# da with prepositions
When used with a preposition, "da" would roughly translate to "it" in the following manner:

German|English
:---:|:---:
damit|with it
darauf|on it
daran|on it
etc.|etc.

# Fractions
Fractions work similarly to cardinal numbers, but they drop the trailing 'n' and add an 'l'.

To say 'one in seven' or 'every seventh', you would say 'jeder siebte' (drop the trailing 'n' entirely and don't add anything)

German|English
:---:|:---:
halb|half (its special)
drittel|third
viertel|quarter
neunzehntel|nineteenth
zwanzigstel|twentieth
etc.|etc.

# Passive Voice
Used in sentences without a subject. To form it, use a form of "werden" with a past participle.

German|English
:---:|:---:
Ich esse den Apfel|I am eating the apple
Der Apfel wird gegessen|The apple is being eaten

# Saying decimal numbers
Decimal numbers are said with the number before the decimal, "Komma" (as in, the comma used instead of a decimal point in German), and then each number individually (or the whole number again).

For example, 23.45 could be "Drei-und-zwanzig-komma-vier-fünf" or "Drei-und-zwanzig-komma-fünf-und-vierzig"

# People as 'the'
Colloquially, people can sometimes be referred to using the definite article. For example, "was meinen Vater betrifft, den finde ich..." would translate to "when it comes to my father, I find **him**"

# Cases
There are four cases in German. They are:
## Nominative
The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence, and also used for the subject of the sein. For example, "ich bin **der** lehrer"
## Accusative
The accusative case is used for the direct object of a sentence and also used with certain prepositions. These follow the acronym FUDGEBOW, and are:
 - für
 - um
 - durch
 - gegen
 - entlang (which is also special in another way - it always goes at the end of a sentence)
 - bis
 - ohne
 - wider

## Genitive
The genitive case is used to convey the possesion. That is, the meaning "of". For example, "die pfoten des hundes" would literally translate to "the paws of the dog", but better idiomatic English would be "the dog's paws". It also gets used after certain prepositions. These are:
- während
- trotz
- statt
- wegen
- innerhalb
- ausserhalb
- jenseits
- dieseits
- unweit

Another important thing to note about genitive is that when using genitive with masculine or neuter words, the nouns themselves will also have an ending appended.

## Dative
The dative case implies the word "to" or "for". It's used with the indirect object of a sentence, with certain verbs, and with certain prepositions. There are lots of verbs that take the dative - a good list is available at https://deutsch.ie/german-grammar/german-verbs/german-verbs-dative-verbs/. A couple of common ones would be helfen and gefallen. The dative case is also used with certain prepositions. These are:
 - mit
 - nach
 - seit
 - von
 - zu
 - ab
 - bei
 - aus
 - ausser
 - gegenüber

# The table of truth
Marvel at its beauty and its truthfulness. Also learn it.
Case|Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|Plural/None
---|---|---|---|---|---
Nominative|Der/Ein|Die/Eine|Das/Ein|Die/Keine
Accusative|Den/Einen|Die/Eine|Das/Ein|Die/Keine
Genitive|Des/Eines|Der/Einer|Des/Eines|Der/Keiner
Dative|Dem/Einem|Der/Einer|Dem/Einem|Den/Keinen

# Adjective endings
Adjective endings are different depending on whether the definite, indefinite, or no article was used before them. This is so that the gender of the word is apparent (most of the time). The tables can be thought of using the image of a 'meat cleaver' - highlighted with the bold ones in this table.

## Adjective endings for the definite article
Case|Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|Plural/None
---|---|---|---|---|---
Nominative|**e**|**e**|**e**|en
Accusative|en|**e**|**e**|en
Genitive|en|en|en|en
Dative|en|en|en|en

For the indefinite, then all of the 'en' endings are the same as the definite, but the masculine and neuter 'e's change so that they reflect the gender (otherwise you wouldn't be able to tell the gender of a word).

## Adjective endings for the definite article
Case|Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|Plural/None
---|---|---|---|---|---
Nominative|**er**|**e**|**es**|en
Accusative|en|**e**|**es**|en
Genitive|en|en|en|en
Dative|en|en|en|en

When there's no article used, the endings are all different, in order to reflect the verb used - the table mostly mirrors the last parts of the definite articles but with the 'es' from 'des' changed to being 'en'.

## Adjective endings for the definite article
Case|Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|Plural/None
---|---|---|---|---|---
Nominative|er|e|es|e
Accusative|en|e|es|e
Genitive|en|er|en|er
Dative|em|er|em|en

# Imperatives
The imperative has three forms in German: for du, ihr, and Sie.
Regular|Imperative|Explanation
---|---|---
Du hörst|Hör|Take the (e)st off of the du form, drop the du
Ihr hört|Hört|Same, just drop the ihr
Sie hören|Hören Sie|Invert subject and verb

#### Imperatives of sein
Sein is irregular:
Regular|Imperative
---|---
Du bist|Sei
Ihr Seid|Seid
Sie sind|Seien Sie

# The Subjunctive
## Forming the subjunctive
There are two sets of conjugations used for subjunctive. Subjunctive 1 is similar to the present tense, while subjunctive 2, or the imperfect subjunctive, is the same as the imperfect for weak verbs, and for strong verbs, is formed by adding a set of endings to the imperfect stem, which has an umlaut added if it contains an "a", "o", or "u".

Person|Subjunctive 1|Subjunctive 2 (of kommen)|Subjunctive 1 of sein
---|---|---|---
ich|spiele|käm**e**|sei
du|spiel**est**|käm**est**|seiest
er/sie/es/man|spiel**e**|käm**e**|sei
wir|spielen|käm**en**|seien
ihr|spiel**et**|käm**et**|seiet
Sie|spielen|käm**en**|seien
For subjunctive 1, the bolded endings are the ones which are different from the present.

## When to use the subjunctive
#### Reported speech
The subjunctive is used in reported speech. For example, when reporting "he said he's playing football", we would use the subjunctive 1 form of spielen to show that it is reported speech: "er sagte, er **spiele** fussball". However, this comes with a small caveat: the subjunctive 2 form of the verb is used with reported speech in one of two cases
 - a) The subjunctive one form of the verb would be the same as the present (eg. for ich, wir, or Sie) - we need to use subjunctive 2 to to show that we're using subjunctive at all.
 - b) We want to show suspicion of what we're reporting.

#### Hypothetical situations
This scenario usually contains "als", "als ob", "wenn", or some other conjunctive, and always uses the subjunctive 2 form of the verb. An example would be the English "if I were you" which becomes "wenn ich dich wäre".

#### Conditional phrases
Conditional phrases (where English would just about always use a form of "would") are done with subjunctive 2 in German. Examples are "that would be great", which becomes "das wäre toll", or "ich hätte gern" which translates to "I would like" (literally "I would have gladly").

#### Pluperfect subjunctive
The pluperfect subjunctive is formed with a form of "hätte" or "wäre" and a past participle, and is used to say what would have been done differently in the past if circumstances had been different. An example would be "if it had rained" becoming "wenn es geregnet hätte".
