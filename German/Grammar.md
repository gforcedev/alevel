# da with prepositions
 - When used with a preposition, "da" would roughly translate to "it" in the following manner:

    German|English
    :---:|:---:
    damit|with it
    darauf|on it
    daran|on it
    etc.|etc.

# Fractions
 - Fractions work similarly to cardinal numbers, but they drop the trailing 'n' and add an 'l'.
   - To say 'one in seven' or 'every seventh', you would say 'jeder siebte' (drop the trailing 'n' entirely and don't add anything)

    German|English
    :---:|:---:
    halb|half (its special)
    drittel|third
    viertel|quarter
    neunzehntel|nineteenth
    zwanzigstel|twentieth
    etc.|etc.

# Passive Voice //TODO: needs more detail
 - Passive voice is used when we don't know who or what did the action.
   - 'ich bin gemobbt worden' translates to 'I have been bullied'.
