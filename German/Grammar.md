# da with prepositions
When used with a preposition, "da" would roughly translate to "it" in the following manner:

German|English
:---:|:---:
damit|with it
darauf|on it
daran|on it
etc.|etc.

# Fractions
Fractions work similarly to cardinal numbers, but they drop the trailing 'n' and add an 'l'.

To say 'one in seven' or 'every seventh', you would say 'jeder siebte' (drop the trailing 'n' entirely and don't add anything)

    German|English
    :---:|:---:
    halb|half (its special)
    drittel|third
    viertel|quarter
    neunzehntel|nineteenth
    zwanzigstel|twentieth
    etc.|etc.

# Passive Voice
Used in sentences without a subject. To form it, use a form of "werden" with a past participle.

    German|English
    :---:|:---:
    Ich esse den Apfel|I am eating the apple
    Der Apfel wird gegessen|The apple is being eaten

# Saying decimal numbers
Decimal numbers are said with the number before the decimal, "Komma" (as in, the comma used instead of a decimal point in German), and then each number individually (or the whole number again).

For example, 23.45 could be "Drei-und-zwanzig-komma-vier-fünf" or "Drei-und-zwanzig-komma-fünf-und-vierzig"

# People as 'the'
Colloquially, people can sometimes be referred to using the definite article. For example, "was meinen Vater betrifft, den finde ich..." would translate to "when it comes to my father, I find **him**"
