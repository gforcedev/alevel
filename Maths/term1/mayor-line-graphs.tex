\section{Line Graphs}
\subsection{Working out a line between two points}
First use $m=\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}$, substituting in the coordinates of the two points to find $m$. Then, substitute this value of $m$, as well as the coordinates from one of the points, into $y=mx+c$. You can solve to find c, and then you have your line equation.
\subsection{Are they parallel?}
If they have the same gradient, then yes.
\subsection{Are they perpendicular?}
If their gradients multiply to -1, then yes.
