\section{Line Graphs}
\subsection{Working out a line between two points}
First use $m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, substituting in the coordinates of the two points to find $m$. Then, substitute this value of $m$, as well as the coordinates from one of the points, into $y=mx+c$. You can solve to find c, and then you have your line equation.
\subsection{Are they parallel?}
If they have the same gradient, then yes.
\subsection{Are they perpendicular?}
If their gradients multiply to -1, then yes.

\section{Lengths and Areas}
To find the distance between two points on a cartesian grid, we can create a right angled triangle and thereby use pythagoras to find the distance. That is to say, for the coordinates $A (x, y)$, and $B (x_1, y_1)$, then the distance between them is equal to $\sqrt{(x-x_1)^2+(y-y_1)^2}$.
