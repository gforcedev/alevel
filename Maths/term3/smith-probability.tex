\section{Probability}
\subsection{Random experiments}
A random experiment is a repeatable action with outcomes that are clearly defined but not possible to accurately predict. The sample space is all of the possible outcomes. An event is a group of outcomes, for example getting an odd number on a six-sided die. All of the possible probabilities in a sample space add to 1.

\subsection{Venn diagrams}
Venn diagrams can be used with either data or probabilities, to show how different events overlap.

\subsection{Independent and mutually exclusive}
If events are mutually exclusive, then there is no overlap:
\begin{equation}
	P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
\end{equation}

If events are independent, then there's the same probability of getting one of each in either order:
\begin{equation}
	P(A \cap B) = P(A)\times P(B)
\end{equation}
