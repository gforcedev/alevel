\section{Regression, correlation, and hypothesis testing}
\subsection{Pearson's Product Moment Correlation}
Pearson's product moment correlation is a measure of linear correlation. It runs from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation), with 0 being no correlation. It allows us to quantify how correlated some data is.

\subsubsection{Calculating ppmcc on a calculator}
To calculate ppmcc on a calculator, go to stats mode and choose $y=a+bx$. Enter the data, and then use the opt button to go to the regression calculation. The y-intercept of the line of best fit is $a$, its gradient is $b$, and $r$ is the ppmcc. A note here that $r$ is the sample ppmcc, the population ppmcc would be $\rho$.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis tests for correlation}
To do a hypothesis test for correlation, the method is mostly the same as the hypothesis tests from year 1. Assume as the null hypothesis that there's no correlation in the populatio ($\rho = 0$), and then the alternative hypothesis is one of $\rho > 0$, $\rho < 0$, or for a two-tailed test $\rho \neq 0$. The value required for $r$ to be enough evidence in a hypothesis test at various significance levels is in a table in the formula booklet. If $r$ is more correlated than the corresponding value for the test, then we can reject $h_0$ and accept $h_1$, and conclude in context as such.
